# No-Knives Cooking Journal

A practical, budget-friendly cooking project for people living with OCD, knife aversion, sensory overwhelm, or anyone who wants gentler kitchen routines. Everything here is **knife-free**, built around scissors, peelers, graters, a steamer, and an air fryer — plus clear, numbered steps.

## About
This project is by Louise.  
It’s part of my journey of living with OCD and intrusive thoughts, and learning to feel more comfortable in the kitchen.  
Some days I struggle — but these adaptations and recipes have helped me prepare food for my family, on a budget, in a way that feels safer.
