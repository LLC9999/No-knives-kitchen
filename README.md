# No-Knives Cooking Journal

A practical, budget-friendly cooking project for people living with OCD, knife aversion, sensory overwhelm, or anyone who just wants gentler kitchen routines. Everything here is **knife-free**, built around scissors, peelers, graters, a steamer and an air fryer — plus clear, numbered steps.
