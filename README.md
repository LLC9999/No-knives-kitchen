# No-Knives Cooking Journal

A practical, budget-friendly cooking project for people living with OCD, knife aversion, sensory overwhelm, or anyone who just wants gentler kitchen routines. Everything here is **knife-free**, built around scissors, peelers, graters, a steamer and an air fryer — plus clear, numbered steps.

- **Author:** Louise  
- **Aim:** Feel more comfortable in the kitchen and, with support, prepare food for family — without knives.  
- **What’s inside:** Adaptations & equipment, full recipes, two-week rotating meal plan, shopping notes, and a printable handout for services (e.g., Alexandra House).
