## Foreword
Cooking wasn’t always hard for me, but since having Harry in 2016 my OCD and intrusive thoughts have made the kitchen feel overwhelming. The biggest trigger is knives and blades, so we don’t keep them in the house. For a while I thought that meant I couldn’t cook. Over time I’ve adapted: round-tip scissors, a dough scraper, graters and peelers, a steamer and an air fryer, and recipes broken into small steps. Cooking with Harry — or “alongside” people virtually — helps keep intrusive thoughts in check.

This journal isn’t about fine dining. It’s about safe, repeatable routines that let me feed my family on a budget — without knives.

## Eating for my wellbeing
After my hysterectomy in 2021 (both ovaries removed), within a week I noticed big swings in temperature regulation and mood. I take oestrogen (oral and vaginal) and vitamin D, and I pay attention to bone health: plenty of dairy alongside beans, lentils, nuts, seeds and veg. Menopause symptoms and mental health feed each other; regular, simple meals help steady things. I’ve more or less stopped drinking: even half a glass brings on a hot sweat, and hangovers are monstrous on antipsychotics — a couple of drinks can wipe out days.

## Kitchen essentials & adaptations (overview)
- **Scissors** (round-tip), **dough scraper**, **box grater**, **safety peeler**  
- **3-tier steamer**, **air fryer**, **microwave**, **immersion blender**  
- **Gloves, tongs, timers**, silicone trays for stock  
Knife-free prep: soak & snip garlic; zest citrus then pierce with a fork to juice; boil/steam root veg whole then snip/mash; snip whole plum tomatoes in the tin; roast chicken whole then shred with 2 forks + gloves.

## How this journal works
Two rotating weeks keep shopping simple and waste low.

### Rhythm
- **Sunday:** one main cook that feeds the week (roast/traybake or batch sauce).  
- **Mon–Wed:** reuse leftovers; one new cook per day.  
- **Midweek baking day:** one dough → two uses (rolls + flatbreads, or muffins + flatbreads).  
- **Thursday:** lentils/beans + flatbreads.  
- **Friday:** pizza night.  
- **Saturday:** leftovers/flexible.  
Freezer: one drawer is enough — frozen veg, some bread/flatbreads, cookie dough balls, stock cubes.
