## What is OCD (plain English)

- **Obsessions**: unwanted thoughts, images or urges that feel intrusive and upsetting (e.g., harm, contamination, morality).  
- **Compulsions**: things you feel you must do to reduce distress or prevent something bad (e.g., checking, reassurance-seeking, mental rituals).  
- Intrusive thoughts are **common** — what matters in OCD is the distress + the cycle of trying to neutralise them. Having intrusive thoughts does **not** make you a bad person.

## Stigma & stereotypes
OCD isn’t “being neat.” It’s an anxiety disorder that can be exhausting and frightening. Good info helps:
