# Support & Urgent Help

This site shares my personal experience, but it is **not medical advice**.  
If you are struggling, please know support is available.

## ðŸš¨ If you need urgent help
- If you or someone else is in immediate danger, **call 999** or go to A&E now.
- If you need urgent help for your mental health, get help from **NHS 111 online** or call **111**.
