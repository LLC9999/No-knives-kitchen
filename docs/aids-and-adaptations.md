# Aids & Adaptations (No-Knives Kitchen)

## Tools I rely on
- **Round-tip kitchen scissors** – herbs, spring onions, cooked chicken, snipping tinned tomatoes.  
- **Dough/bench scraper** – portion dough; press-cut soft veg; lift & tidy; slice traybakes.  
- **Box grater & safety peeler** – onions/carrots/celery bases; ribbons of veg.  
- **3-tier steamer** – veg, dumplings; simple timers.  
- **Air fryer & microwave** – quick, energy-saving, single-basket meals.  
- **Immersion blender** – soup/sauce smoothness.  
- **Gloves, tongs** – meat handling & sensory comfort.  
- **Timers/phone alarms** – basting, stirring, changing settings.  
- **Silicone ice-cube trays** – freeze reduced stock.

## My knife-free prep tricks
- **Garlic:** soak cloves in hot water; snip skin; clove pops out.  
- **Citrus:** zest first; pierce with a fork and squeeze.  
- **Onion/carrot/celery:** grate or guarded mandolin — brilliant base for soups & stews.  
- **Root veg:** peel if you like, cook whole; snip ends after soft; mash or slice with scraper.  
- **Chicken:** roast whole; shred with gloves and two forks.  
- **Tinned tomatoes:** buy whole plum; snip in the tin.  
- **Tomato purée:** always on hand — body and richness without chopping.

## Sensory & routine supports
- Do **one task at a time**: season → prep → cook.  
- **Ear defenders or calming audio**; avoid total noise-blocking.  
- **Printed, numbered steps** (use colours that suit dyslexia).  
- Cook with **company** (family or virtual) when possible.  
- **One freezer drawer** is enough: frozen veg, some bread/flatbreads, cookie dough balls, stock cubes.

## Shared food spaces (BBQs/buffets)
These are hard: unknown ingredients, textures, hygiene, many hands, little veg/fruit.  
What helps: bring a safe option; keep a backup snack in your bag; “I’m fine, thanks” is enough; plan a nourishing snack when you get home.
