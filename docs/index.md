title: No-Knives Cooking
---

Welcome to my knife-free cooking journal. It’s about simple, budget-friendly meals and the adaptations that help me feel safer in the kitchen.

This isn’t a journal about fancy dishes. It’s about my journey to create safe, repeatable routines that help me feel more comfortable and confident in the kitchen.
