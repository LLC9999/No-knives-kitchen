This site is written from my own lived experience of OCD, intrusive thoughts, and recovery.  

To protect my mental health, I have chosen to keep this project **anonymous**.  
- I am not on social media.  
- I don’t share personal identifiers beyond what I choose to write here.  
- Everything shared is about my journey and the adaptations that help me, not about anyone else’s private lives.  

Thank you for respecting this choice. It allows me to share openly while still looking after my own wellbeing.  

If you are struggling yourself, please remember this site is not medical advice.  
Support is available:  
- **999** — in an emergency  
- **111** — for urgent medical help  
- **Samaritans** — 116 123 (free, 24/7)  
- Or your GP for mental health support
